# 🧠 AI Research Assistant

A Python-based terminal research assistant that uses **Tavily** for intelligent web search and **OpenAI GPT-4** to generate well-formatted, intelligent answers from the retrieved data.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔎 Accepts user queries and searches the web using **Tavily API**
- 🧠 Generates detailed, coherent answers using **OpenAI GPT-4**
- 📚 Accumulates all retrieved knowledge over a session
- 🔁 Accepts multiple queries in a loop until user exits
- ✅ Clean, structured code with `match-case` switch (Python 3.10+)

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User inputs a question.
2. Tavily retrieves relevant web content.
3. Content is added to an internal `knowledge_base`.
4. OpenAI GPT-4 uses that knowledge base to formulate an answer.
5. The process repeats until the user types `quit`.

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `openai`
- `tavily`

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install openai tavily
```

---

## 🔐 API Keys

You will need:

- A **Tavily API key** — [Get it here](https://www.tavily.com/)
- An **OpenAI API key** — [Get it here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

Replace the placeholders in the script with your own keys:

```python
tavily_client = TavilyClient("your-tavily-api-key")
openai_client = OpenAI(api_key="your-openai-api-key")
```

---

## 🧩 Code Overview

```python
# Start by initializing API clients
tavily_client = TavilyClient("your-tavily-api-key")
openai_client = OpenAI(api_key="your-openai-api-key")

# Begin with an empty knowledge base
knowledge_base = ""

while True:
    user_question = input("What do you want to research on? ")

    match user_question.lower():
        case "quit":
            break
        case _:
            # Get data from Tavily
            # Append to knowledge_base
            # Send knowledge_base + question to GPT-4
            # Print the formatted answer
```

## 🧠 Example Usage
### go yo tour terminal after installing this file and enter "python AI-research-agent.py" and you will be able to use this agent

you will see somethig like this :

Welcome to the Research Assistant! Type 'quit' to exit.

What do you want to research on? history of artificial intelligence

Answer:
Artificial intelligence (AI) has its roots in the 1950s with the work of pioneers like Alan Turing...
